# Heartbeat Sensor Project Using 8051 Microcontroller

## Overview
This project involves designing a heartbeat sensor system using an 8051 microcontroller. The system detects and monitors heartbeat rates, displaying the results on 7-segment LEDs. The code for this project is written entirely in assembly language, leveraging the capabilities of the 8051 microcontroller to create an efficient and functional design.

## Features
- Real-time heartbeat monitoring
- Display of heartbeat rate on 7-segment LEDs
- Accurate pulse counting using a microcontroller
- Compact design suitable for educational and practical purposes

## Components
1. **Microcontroller**: 8051 microcontroller
2. **Heartbeat Sensor**: Pulse sensor module
3. **Display**: 7-segment LEDs
4. **Power Supply**: 5V DC supply
5. **Passive Components**: Resistors, capacitors, and connecting wires
6. **Other Components**: Crystal oscillator, push buttons for reset

## Working Principle
1. The heartbeat sensor detects the pulse rate of the user and generates an analog signal.
2. The analog signal is processed and converted into a digital signal.
3. The 8051 microcontroller reads the digital signal and calculates the heartbeat rate.
4. The calculated value is displayed on the 7-segment LEDs.

## Assembly Code
The code for the project is written in assembly language. It performs the following tasks:
- Initializes the 7-segment display and microcontroller ports
- Processes input signals from the heartbeat sensor
- Computes the heartbeat rate
- Updates the 7-segment display with the calculated value

## Circuit Diagram
Include the schematic diagram of the circuit showing the connections between the 8051 microcontroller, the heartbeat sensor, and the 7-segment LEDs. Ensure proper labeling for clarity.

## Instructions to Run the Project
